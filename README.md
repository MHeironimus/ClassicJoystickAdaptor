# Ultimate Classic Game Console Joystick USB Adaptor (ClassicJoystickAdaptor)
Software for the Arduino Leonardo and Arduino Micro that allow these devices to become USB adaptors for classic game console joysticks (e.g. Atari 2600, ColecoVision, and Coleco ADAM game controllers).
## Arduino IDE Version 1.6.5 and earlier
For Arduino IDE Version 1.6.5 or earlier, please use the Arduino-1.6.5 branch. I do not plan on making future enhancements to this branch, but I have left it available for reference and people who are still using the Arduino IDE verstion 1.6.5 or earlier.
## Arduino IDE Version 1.6.6 or later
For Arduino IDE Version 1.6.6 or later, please use the main branch. This is the branch that will see future updates.
## Hardware - Building Your Own Adapter
